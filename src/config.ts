 * Parses a numeric env var, refusing anything that wouldn't behave as a limit.

 * `Number()` alone is not enough for values that guard a resource boundary:
 * `Number("8MB")` is NaN, and every `size > NaN` comparison is false, so a typo
 * silently removes the cap it was meant to tighten. An empty value is treated
 * as unset rather than as 0, since `Number("")` is 0 and a 0-byte cap would
 * reject every file instead of obviously failing.
 *
 * "Positive and finite" is necessary but not sufficient, hence `min`/`max`:
 * every one of these knobs has a domain outside which a *technically valid*
 * number still misbehaves silently rather than loudly. A poll interval of 0.5
 * becomes a millisecond-scale hot loop against herdr; any delay above 2^31-1 is
 * coerced by Node to 1ms, so an absurdly long interval acts like the shortest
 * possible one; a port over 65535 fails at listen() long after config load; and
 * a file cap of 1e308 passes here but overflows to Infinity once multiplied
 * into bytes, disabling the comparison it exists for. Callers state the real
 * domain so the value is rejected at startup with its own name attached.

 * of transient allocation here. Measured against the free-tier VM the Hub
